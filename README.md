# 📐 Ellipse Perimeter Approximation

This project provides fast and accurate methods to approximate the **perimeter of an ellipse**, using:

- ✅ High-precision elliptic integrals (up to **10000 digits**) as reference
- 🔍 A **13-digit elliptic integral** version for practical use
- 🧮 A **Fourier series** approximation
- 🟣 A **Chebyshev polynomial** approximation
- 📜 **Ramanujan's classical formula**

The project compares accuracy and execution time of all methods, and visualizes their errors.
